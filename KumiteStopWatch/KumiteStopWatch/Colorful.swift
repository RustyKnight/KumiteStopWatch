	This is probably the worse name for a protocol EVER, but I'm having
	a hard time trying to think up a good one...
	- ColorGradientable...
	- ColorBandable?
	- ColorMeCrazy?

	Basically, there are a number of layers that use the ColorBand from the TimeLine
	for updating their states, but they don't actually need the TimeLine itself, just
	the ColorBand information
