/**
The purpose of this class is to make it easier to monitor the current animation
state of a view, so it can be more easily paused/resumed.

I'd love to make this a delegate of the animaitons, but as I understand it, that's
kind of a bad idea, as the view is suppose to be taking responsibility for that

This means that the caller is still responsible for managing so of the state, but
the core functionality is mainatined by a single class, rather then any number of 
flags and algorithims
