#Kumite Stop Watch

The Kumite Stop Watch is a purpose built, 2 minute stop watch, with a 1 minute 30 second "alert", which can be used to time kumite (sparing) bouts

The stop watch supports pause/resume/reset functionality, allowing flexibility in it's over all use.

The "base" design is based around the tournament specifications for the Go Kan Ryu Karate-Do club with the intention to provide customisation features in later releases, allowing the user to define multiple different stop watches, each with their own configuration.

The project is a personal project used to test ideas and designs, the intention is to have a base line repository with multiple branches supporting different ideas and designs, used to demonstrate my understanding the iOS API.

This project is based on an earlier project, written in Objective-C that used Core Graphics to render the primary stop watch. This project suffered from some performance issues, which this project is designed to address
